CareWell

The 43.5 million Americans who care for aging family members face significant health issues, financial instability, family strife, social isolation, and burnout. They and the elders they help suffer. As the number of elderly Americans skyrockets, we need ways to provide compassionate, long-term elder care.

CareWell interrupts the cycles of stress that erode caregiving by attracting friends and family to join in. CareWell is a mobile and web-based task and help coordination tool. It offers caregivers new non-invasive methods for recruiting, managing, motivating and recognizing long-term help.

CareWell allows families caring for aging loved ones to share tasks, upload photos, and provide positive encouragement to each other through simple interactions.
